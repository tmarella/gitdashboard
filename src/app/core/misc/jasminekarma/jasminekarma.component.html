  <h5>Jasmine</h5>
  <p class="lead">
    Jasmine is a JavaScript testing framework that supports a software development practice called Behaviour-Driven
    Development. Itâ€™s a specific flavour of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
  </p>
  <p>Jasmine provides builtin functions that we need to use to create a test</p>
  <ul>
    <li>describe(string, function): to define a suite, collection of individual Test Specs.</li>
    <li>it(string, function): to define a spec or a test, this contains one or more Test Expectations.</li>
    <li>expect(actual): is for Expectation. It describes an expected piece of behaviour in the application.</li>
    <li>matcher(expected): expression is what we call a Matcher. Few pre-built matchers are toContain(). toBe(), toEqual() etc</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Karma</h5>
  <p class="lead">
    Karma is the default test runner for applications created with the Angular CLI. Karma is a tool which lets us spawn
    browsers and run Jasmine tests inside of them all from the command line. The results of the tests are also displayed
    on the command line.
  </p>
  <p>When creating Angular projects using the Angular CLI it defaults to creating and running unit tests using Jasmine
    and Karma.</p>
  <h5>Setup and Teardown</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>beforeAll: This function is called once, before all the specs in a test suite (describe function) are run. </li>
    <li>afterAll: This function is called once after all the specs in a test suite are finished. </li>
    <li>beforeEach: This function is called before each test specification (it function) is run. </li>
    <li>afterEach: This function is called after each test specification is run. </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Angular TestBed(ATB)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>The Angular Test Bed (ATB) is a higher level Angular Only testing framework that allows us to easily test behaviours that depend on the Angular Framework.</li>
    <li>We still write our tests in Jasmine and run using Karma but we now have a slightly easier way to create components, handle injection, test asynchronous behaviour and interact with our application.</li>
    <li>In the beforeEach function for our test suite we configure a testing module using the TestBed class.</li>
    <li>This creates a test Angular Module which we can use to instantiate components, perform dependency injection and so on.</li>
    <li>We configure it in exactly the same way as we would configure a normal NgModule. </li>
    <li>A fixture is a wrapper for a component and its template.</li>
    <li>We create an instance of a component fixture through the TestBed, this injects the AuthService into the component constructor.</li>
    <li>We can find the actual component from the componentInstance on the fixture.</li>
    <li>We can get resolve dependencies using the TestBed injector by using the get function.</li>
    <li>Once the ATB is setup, we can use it to instantiate components and resolve dependencies like below</li>
